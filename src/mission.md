Tutor Interventions came to fruition in April 2018, because I wanted to spend my time teaching students who needed support, as opposed to other increasing demands placed upon a teacher within a school environment. Building positive relationships with students is important! Making progress and moving towards mastery for the student's benefit, not for statistics or shareholders.

Each session is spent focusing on the student's needs and requirements, using a multi-sensory approach and a variety of strategies and resources. These can include the use of games, puzzles and the online learning spaces – [Mathletics](http://uk.mathletics.com/) and [Spellodrome](http://uk.spellodrome.com/#/home).
