#### Dee P

This is my second lesson with Rachael. She is very professional and organised. In the hour she’s here they get a lot done. My son is also very happy being tutored by Rachael.

Great tutor committed to my daughter and able to manage her complex needs using different techniques and humour.
My daughter can be difficult to engage/encourage and has low self-esteem, with Rachael’s support she is learning and her confidence is growing and showing through already.
